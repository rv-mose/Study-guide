    <h1>How to Earn Money Online for Beginners</h1>

    <p>
      Earning money online has become very popular, especially for students and beginners.
      If you are new and don’t know where to start, this guide will help you understand
      simple, genuine, and safe ways to earn money online without investment.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Freelancing</h2>
    <p>
      Freelancing means offering your skills online to clients. You can work from home and
      earn money using platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and Freelancer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Common freelance skills include content writing, graphic design, video editing,
      data entry, and web development.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Blogging</h2>
    <p>
      Blogging is one of the best long-term ways to earn money online. You create a website,
      write helpful articles, and earn money through Google AdSense and affiliate marketing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blogging does not give instant income, but with consistency and good content,
      it can generate passive income.
    </p>

    <h2>3. YouTube Channel</h2>
    <p>
      If you are comfortable speaking or creating videos, YouTube is a great option.
      You can create videos related to education, tech, gaming, or daily life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once your channel grows, you can earn money through ads, sponsorships, and affiliate links.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Online Tutoring</h2>
    <p>
      If you are good at any subject, you can teach online. Many platforms allow you
      to teach students from different parts of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Online tutoring is especially good for students and teachers.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Using Online Tools & Apps</h2>
    <p>
      Some genuine apps and websites pay users for completing simple tasks like surveys,
      testing apps, or micro-jobs. This is suitable for beginners who want small earnings.
    </p>

    <h2>Important Tips for Beginners</h2>
